All I can think about is you and I. 
Going back to schooling, we cooling, getting by.
I remember being infatuated with your thick thighs and pretty eyes, 
my feelings I always try to disguise,
but lately, I been thinking about you. 
And if you were mine what would we do,
but I know these feelings are true. 
I put my heart in a rhyme, hoping you'll give me time. 
Loving you 9-5 girl you are my grind. 
Hold my hand we can reach the stars.
Just vibe to these emotions written down in these bars.
This aint no joke sprung after the first words you spoke.
Cupid aimed for the heart, and it was murder she wrote. 
We can take it real slow. 
I want to love your soul. 
Take your time with me nobody gotta know.


(Hook) x2
Told her simmer down I'mma take my time.
Make her feel like she is divine
Put my heart written deeply down in this rhyme
Baby girl you are one of a kind


Now you are mine, how could this be?
All these dudes in the world and you really chose me
I mastered that verture, girl I had that patience.
All the while stuck in my infatuations
You gave me a chance now I'm your man
I'mma put in this time til you understand
My love for you is noble like an ounce of gold,
If you don't get it girl, it means that it'll never corrode
