I have all this pressure in my life.
And it seems everything that I do, only results in strife.
What's a dude to do when his back is against the wall.
Trying to catch my ground, but instead I rapidly fall.

I have a son and wife, and they both depend on me.
I have a solid job trying to be all I can be.
I'm tired of the pain, tired of the hurt, tired of the strain, tired of feeling like dirt.
Lord deliver me from the devil, for now I know you are the reason to revel.


So what is a nigga supposed to do besides roll it up.
Not talking fruit nigga I'm talking blunts.
Get high and fuck my problems, fuck my fears, fuck everything that brings me tears.
Never coming down, never coming down, never again will I ever frown.
