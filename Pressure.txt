I have all this pressure in my life.
And it seems everything that I do, only results in strife.
What's a dude to do when his back is against the wall.
Trying to catch my ground, but instead I rapidly fall.

I have a son and wife, and they both depend on me.
I have a solid job trying to be all I can be.
I'm tired of the pain, tired of the hurt, tired of the strain, tired of feeling like dirt.
Lord deliver me from the devil, for now I know you are the reason to revel.
