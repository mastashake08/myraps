You know what I'm gonna do
Summer 2016 me and my crew
Flying out to Cali and we writing apps
Then turn around and then write some raps
Holla back, holla back
You can't touch us and our stacks
Lyrics so fire can light up my blunt
Practice makes perfect, went from a rookie, now I stunt
Spitting poetry in motion
Now I have a cali condo right next to the ocean
Now I got a badass wife whippin up this potion
I'm that nigga now if you did not get that notion
Asking what I'm doing? Fuck you mean
I'm out here manifesting all my dreams.
And in the in-between, I'm getting all this cream.
It really wasn't hard when I put in the time
It got even easier as it stayed on my mind
I know this is bigger than me, it's something divine
So I'mma keep hustlin and put it in a rhyme
So when the tell me to stop I gotta keep tryin'
Devil be trying to discourage me, but I know he be lyin'
Got a son, found out I'm having a daughter.
All the more reason for a nigga to hustle harder.
This is manifest destiny, this was what was meant to be.
Went from a bastard, now I'm a silicon king,
Let it ring, let it sing, 
I want everybody to know that I did the thing
I beat the odds like it was cee-lo 4, 5, 6
Ha ha ha, now I'm winning at this bitch
Flow so cold, code so gold
