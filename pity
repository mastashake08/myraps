Thinking about my life, full of self pity.
In every aspect seems as if life was trying to get me.
Dad behind bars since I was two.
But hey, that's all the life I ever knew.
Mom has men in and out of her life.
Doing nothing but causing our life strife.
Brother and I used to be so close.
Used to be the dudes who talked the most.
Now we only Kik every now and then.
It's a shame when I think of what could have been.
I seem to like to push people away.
But what I'm really trying to do is keep the pain at bay.
They say know thyself, but who am I?
Stuck on my past, and all the time that flew by.
Time spent thinking of a lie.
Heartbroken eyes staring at mine.
Now I'm sitting here thinking of a line, a phrase, any words to leave this maze.
Not manning up when the opportunity was there.
Not taking the time to be 360 self-aware.
Blessed enough to be with someone who can forgive.
Willing to help me as I learn to live.
How does a man truly atone?
Lord please give a sign to Jyrone.
Pressures of the world, enough to break your back.
Enough to make the sanest man crack.
Mathematically I'm not supposed to be here.
See remnants of the system in me everyday in the mirror.
Animalistic struggles war on the inside.
Battle for my soul, feeling the forces collide.
